## Welcome!

Hi there! 👋🏻 This is a repo that I've worked on for the [Project: Recipes](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). It is basically a list of recipes for my all time favourite dishes! 🤤 🍛

I've got the recipes from here:

1. [Sambal Ikan Bilis](https://dishbyili.com/sambal-ikan-bilis/)
2. [Maggie Goreng Mamak](https://www.maggi.my/en/recipes/3-step-maggi-goreng-mamak/)
3. [Tomyam Fried Rice](https://www.maggi.my/en/recipes/tom-yam-fried-rice/)

By doing the project, I was able to apply the knowledge I have learned from the HTML Foundations mainly about _elements and tags_, _lists_, and also _links and images_.

      Mamak stalls are open-air food establishments particularly found in
      Southeast Asia, particularly in both Malaysia and Singapore. These stalls
      serve a type of Indian Muslim cuisine unique to the region. It is a
      favourite spot for night owls to hangout with friends, catch the latest
      football matches or a respite for hungry patrons in general — the perfect
      epitome of Malaysia’s bustling nightlife.

      The origins of mamak stalls can be traced back to the 19th century with
      Indian-Muslim traders visiting the Malay Archipelago for business and
      trading activities. Along with their cultural background, the traders
      settled down and introduced their culinary expertise which are evident in
      mamak stalls today. Spicy curries with aromatic rice, smooth frothy milk
      tea and flatbread, there are so many culinary delights a mamak stall can
      offer.

      MAGGI® noodles are synonymous with mamak stalls, with MAGGI® Goreng Mamak
      noodles being the most popular and representative dish. MAGGI® Goreng
      Mamak is usually served with a sunny side-up, cucumber slices and
      vegetables — add a huge piece of crunchy fried chicken if you don’t mind
      the calories! Whenever you visit a mamak stall, you will see rows and rows
      of MAGGI noodles in every flavour neatly stacked near the cooking area.
      MAGGI® Goreng Mamak is relatively easy to make with simple ingredients
      such as MAGGI curry noodles, eggs, MAGGI® Chilli Sauce, ketchup, beancurd
      and vegetables — frying it continuously on a stove over high heat gives
      the chewy noodles a charred fragrance. Before tucking into your MAGGI®
      Goreng Mamak, squeeze some lime juice onto your dish for a tangy sensation
      to pull the flavours together. Waiters dished out plates of MAGGI® Goreng
      Mamak and an array of other dishes, together with glasses of teh tarik and
      other refreshing beverages to wash down tasty meals. Meals are served in
      huge portions here, at an affordable price!

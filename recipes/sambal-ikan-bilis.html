    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Sambal ikan bilis is one of the side dish for Malaysia's national dish,
      Nasi Lemak. However, people also eat Sambal Ikan Bilis with plain rice and
      with Roti Canai. Sambal ikan bilis tastes spicy due to the chillis and has
      that saltiness coming from the anchovies.

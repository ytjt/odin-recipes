      between sour, salty and spicy, it has captured the hearts of many. The Tom
      Yum Fried Rice can be enjoyed anytime, anywhere as this dish is simple and

      Why have it in restaurants when you can embrace your inner chef and
      prepare it from the comfort of your home? Besides that, this dish is also
      well balanced and nutritious, as it contains protein like squid and
      prawns, and vegetables, such as green beans, carrots and baby corn. Fry
      all the ingredients together and you have your very own home-cooked Tom
      Yum Fried Rice. Psst… here's a pro tip to perfecting this dish; make sure
      to use thoroughly-chilled cooked rice to achieve a fluffy Tom Yum Fried
      Rice. Don't forget to use the MAGGI® Tom Yum Stock Cube to get an
      authentic Tom Yum flavour. Simply sprinkle the crushed seasoning cube that
      is rich in fresh herbs and spices in your dish, adding flavour and
      unleashing the Tom Yum aroma in your kitchen. Remember to add a little
      water if the ingredients fried are too dry and start sticking to the pan.

      However, make sure to maintain a thick consistency before adding in the
      rice. Moreover, always cook at low heat to ensure that the rice is cooked
      perfectly. Stir-fry the prawns and squid first as its stock adds flavour
      to the Tom Yum Fried Rice. Oh! If you enjoy spicy food, add a few stalks
      of chopped bird's eye chilli to the dish for an extra kick. Top it off
      with some scallions and fried shallots, and you're done! Enjoy this
      delicious Tom Yum Fried Rice with friends and family for breakfast, lunch
      or dinner. What are you waiting for? Start cooking!
